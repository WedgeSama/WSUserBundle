WSUserBundle
=============

A Symfony2 bundle. A complete User system:
- Login/Logout
- Registration
- Password forget (in progress...)
- My account (in progress...)
- Group system
- Admin backend (in progress...)
- Blacklist by IP (in progress...)

#### Why I develop this bundle instead of use FOSUserBundle?
I already use FOSUserBundle for some of my previous projects but 
I want to now how the Symfony user system works. So I decided to 
create this bundle to learn it.
